- 2009 - 2011 Lived in Canada. With Mélanie. Whom I miss a great deal and get to talk to still which I'm grateful for. Great friends that I miss very much now. Worked for startups and was co-founder for my first one. 
- 2009- 2011 Was difficult to be away from my Family, not just for a short period of time now, but maybe sort of permanently. It made me think. 
- 2011 Came back to Finland. Hello friends! I love Finland! Some people actually told me straight to my face it was great to have me back. That made an impression on me. Love you.
